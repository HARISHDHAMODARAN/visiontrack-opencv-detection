# visiontrack-opencv-detection
Real-time object detection in images using OpenCV and SSD MobileNet.

Welcome to **VisionTrack** – a fun and practical computer vision project where we detect real-world objects in images using a pre-trained deep learning model. Whether you're learning about object detection or just want to see some cool AI in action, this project has you covered!

## 💡 What This Project Does

VisionTrack uses OpenCV’s Deep Neural Network (DNN) module along with a pre-trained **SSD MobileNet V2** model to spot and label objects like cars, people, and bikes in images. You give it an image, and it highlights the objects inside with bounding boxes and names. It’s based on the **COCO** dataset – a popular dataset with 80 common object categories.

## 🧰 Features

- 📸 Detects multiple objects in a single image
- 🧠 Uses a pre-trained deep learning model (no training required!)
- 🖼️ Draws bounding boxes and labels over detected objects
- 🔍 Visual results displayed using Matplotlib
- 🐍 Lightweight and runs entirely in Python with OpenCV
